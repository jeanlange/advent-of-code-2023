## Days 1/2
* Use a class to parse each line
* I want 'scan', not 'match', to find multiple regex matches
* refresh on something I always have to look up: `File.open("name.txt").each do |line|`
* refresh on that map syntax:
  * `.map{|value| value.function}` becomes
  * `.map(&:function)`
  * the parens change. That always gets me.
